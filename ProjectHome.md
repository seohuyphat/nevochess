This project is aimed to create an full featured Xiangqi application for iPhone/iPod touch devices. The application will be able to support both online and offline mode . The dedicated service is hosted at http://www.playxiangqi.com.

## **Important notice** ##
This project is actually the fork of original [podchess](http://code.google.com/p/podchess/) which will be the host for western chess . Besides, since **podchess** contains "pod" which is prohibited (sensitive)  by Apple to appear in iPhone AppStore application name , so the **podchess** would be most likely to target third-party appstore, such as [Cydia](http://cydia.saurik.com), or [91 assistant](http://soft.sj.91.com/). More information about **podchess**, please visit http://code.google.com/p/podchess

## **Note** ##
Although this project is stored in subversion repository, we strongly recommend you to check out the code via [git-svn](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html), since [git](http://git-scm.com/) would make us and you feel more comfortable to contribute. Please see Wiki page for how to get start with **git-svn**
